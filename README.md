# KMMTemplate

[![Template configuration for KMM project](https://github.com/daresaydigital/KMM-Template-Wizard/actions/workflows/template_configuration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/daresaydigital/KMM-Template-Wizard/actions/workflows/template_configuration.yml)

KMMTemplate is a GitHub Action that helps you generate a KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) project with your desired dependencies. It provides a user-friendly wizard that allows you to select the dependencies you need, and then automatically generates the project structure and configuration files.

## Current Features

At present, KMMTemplate includes default configurations for the following dependencies:

- **[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)**: A powerful dependency injection framework.
- **[SQLDelight](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/)**: A library that simplifies working with SQL databases.
- **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)**: A robust query language for APIs.
- **[Multiplatform Settings](https://github.com/radarsh/MultiplatformSettings)**: A convenient solution for managing settings across platforms.

While these dependencies are implemented, there are still many more options available in the GitHub Action that are yet to be realized. We invite you to join our community and contribute by implementing additional dependencies to enhance KMMTemplate further.
